## How to use

**From Github:**<br>
1. Go to `/CodexNaturalis/deliverables/final/jar` folder
2. Select CPU architecture (`x86` or `aarch64`)
3. Download `Server.jar` and `Client.jar`
4. Open `CMD` and navigate to C:/[dir]/[directory where you downloaded the jar files]
5. From here, just type in the `CMD`:  
   -> `java -jar Server.jar` (to run the server)<br>
   -> `java -jar Client.jar` (to run the clients)

You will be prompted to choose between TUI or GUI mode and Socket or RMI communication protocol.
